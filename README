================= LibRaw dcraw-dist-track branch ====================

This branch is for tracking original dcraw.c revisions. It should not be used
for real development. LibRaw does not compile in this branch ever.

Unfortunately, this branch created in git (GitHub) too late, so it is not possible to remove unneeded files from it. Sorry.

Generally, no one needs this branch except LibRaw core team.
