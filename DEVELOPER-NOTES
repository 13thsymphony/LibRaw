=== Notes for LibRaw contributor ===

1. Some files in internal/ folder are generated from dcraw/dcraw.c file
   by simple preprocessor internal/preprocess.pl (you need perl to run it)

 . dcraw/dcraw.c is a *patched* dcraw (and foveon processng code is removed
   due to copyright).

   'Official' dcraw.c changes are tracked by LibRaw team and merged to 
   head revision at regular basis.

   So, if you want to change code in internal/*.cpp files you need to change
   dcraw/dcraw.c (and run make)

2. LibRaw distribution files are prepared by ./mkdist.sh script
   This script
     - regenerates internal/*cpp without #line directives
     - replaces Makefile with Makefile.dist
     - fetches 'Official' dcraw.c from Dave Coffin's site
     - removes .PSD files from doc/
     - removes itself

3. ./configure script generates ./Makefile from ./Makefile.in and command line options.
   Do not use ./configure in development enviroment, it is for distribution only.
